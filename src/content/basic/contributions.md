## We are not accepting contributions at this time



It is the intention of our foundation to remain self-funded for as long as we can. We understand that many citizens look for charities that reflect their compassion for others while taking care that charities they support have a low expense to giving ratios. Eventually our gifting will be reported on the IRS form 990 and you can judge for yourself the effectiveness of the Dave and Wendy Morgan Foundation in keeping our expenses down and gifting up.

However, for those of you who insist on supporting this foundation, you will need to email our Treasurer Mr. Christopher Morgan to obtain our current donation receiving methods.

PS: Neither the founders nor members of the Foundation's board are compensated for their services.
